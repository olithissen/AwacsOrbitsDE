# Supplementary notes

The following corrections were added manually

- The westermost point of orbit area **NG2** should be `53°17.00′N 007°12.00′E` to touch the Dutch-German border near Emden but is documented as `53°17.00′N 011°00.00′E` in *ENR 5.2*
- The western boundary of orbit area **NG4** is defined by the French-German border. Missing coordinates have been added manually

The following details are currently missing

- Orbits **NG84** and **NG85** near Berlin can be combined to form a figure eight pattern named **NG88**
- Orbits **NG82** and **NG83** near Rügen can be combined to form race track pattern named **NG86** or a figure eight pattern named **NG87**
